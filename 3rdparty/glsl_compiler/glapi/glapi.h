/**
 * \mainpage Mesa GL API Module
 *
 * \section GLAPIIntroduction Introduction
 *
 * The Mesa GL API module is responsible for dispatching all the
 * gl*() functions.  All GL functions are dispatched by jumping through
 * the current dispatch table (basically a struct full of function
 * pointers.)
 *
 * A per-thread current dispatch table and per-thread current context
 * pointer are managed by this module too.
 *
 * This module is intended to be non-Mesa-specific so it can be used
 * with the X/DRI libGL also.
